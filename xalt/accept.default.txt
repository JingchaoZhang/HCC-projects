# This is a accept file:
# `#' are comments to the end of line.
# The format is one pattern per line
# blank lines are ignored as well as leading and trailing blanks.
# Remember to put a leading '^' to match the beginning of the path:

# Acceptance is done before the ignore list so put in here the
# absolute path of program you want to run that would otherwise
# be in ignore list.  For example /usr/bin/ddt might be a program
# your site would like to track but all other programs in /usr/bin
# are ignored:

# /usr/bin/ddt
