Data Mining
============

With the data collected from XALT, there are a range of reports and analysis that can be created.  

Trend reports may be produced for:
	
	* :ref:`modulefilelabel`
	
	* :ref:`library`
	
	* :ref:`application`
	
	* :ref:`provenance`
	
	* :ref:`stats`
	
	* :ref:`programenv`
	
	* :doc:`080_usecase`

Example queries were created for use with Darter & Mars at NICS, where xalt_run.syshost='darter'

.. _modulefilelabel:

Module File Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Occurrences of the modulefile name::

	mysql> SELECT module_name, count(date) AS cnt from xalt_link, join_link_object, xalt_object 
	WHERE build_syshost='darter' AND
	xalt_link.link_id = join_link_object.link_id AND
	join_link_object.obj_id = xalt_object.obj_id 
	GROUP BY module_name
	ORDER BY cnt DESC;

Occurrences of the modulefile name without NULL module_name entries included::

	mysql> SELECT module_name, count(date) AS cnt from xalt_link, join_link_object, xalt_object 
	WHERE build_syshost='darter' AND
	module_name is not NULL AND 
	xalt_link.link_id = join_link_object.link_id AND 
	join_link_object.obj_id = xalt_object.obj_id 
	GROUP BY module_name 
	ORDER BY cnt DESC;

Report of modulefile usage based on shared library usage at run time
ordered by number of occurrences used::

	mysql> SELECT xalt_object.module_name, count(date) AS Jobs, ROUND(SUM(run_time*num_cores)/3600) as TotalSUs from xalt_run, join_run_object, xalt_object 
	WHERE xalt_run.syshost='mars' AND
	xalt_object.module_name is NOT NULL AND 
	xalt_run.run_id = join_run_object.run_id AND 
	join_run_object.obj_id = xalt_object.obj_id AND 
	date >= '2014­11­01' AND date <= '2014­11­09'
	GROUP BY xalt_object.module_name 
	ORDER BY Jobs DESC;

Counts of the module files based on static library usage at
runtime::

	mysql> SELECT xalt_object.module_name, count(xalt_run.date) AS Jobs, ROUND(SUM(run_time*num_cores)/3600) as TotalSUs from xalt_run,xalt_link, join_link_object, xalt_object 
	WHERE xalt_run.syshost='darter' AND 
	xalt_object.module_name is NOT NULL AND
	xalt_run.uuid = xalt_link.uuid AND 
	xalt_link.link_id = join_link_object.link_id AND join_link_object.obj_id =
	xalt_object.obj_id AND xalt_run.date >= '2014­11­01' AND
	xalt_run.date <= '2014­11­09' GROUP BY xalt_object.module_name ORDER
	BY Jobs DESC;
	
.. _library:

Library Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This query will return a report first sorted in descending order the most used libraries (objects) for a
specified machine based on number of times it appears in a link::

	mysql> SELECT object_path, module_name, count(date) AS cnt from xalt_link, join_link_object, xalt_object 
	WHERE build_syshost='darter'AND 
	xalt_link.link_id = join_link_object.link_id AND
	join_link_object.obj_id = xalt_object.obj_id 
	GROUP BY object_path
	ORDER BY cnt DESC;
	
.. _application:

Application Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _provenance:

Provenance and Reproducibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This example query returned the necessary information for building a project ::

	mysql> SELECT object_path, timestamp
	FROM xalt_object, join_link_object
	WHERE join_link_obkect.link_id="4" AND
	join_link_object.obj_id=xalt_object.obj_id;

.. _stats:

Usage Statstics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _programenv:

Restoring the Program Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
