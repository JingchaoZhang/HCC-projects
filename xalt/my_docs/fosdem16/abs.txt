Title: XALT: Tracking User Jobs and Environments on a Cluster


Let's talk real, no-kiddin' supercomputer analytics, aimed at moving
beyond monitoring the machine as a whole or even its individual
hardware components. We're interested in drilling down to the level of
individual tasks, users, and binaries. Weâ€™re after ready
answers to the "what, where, how, when and why" that stakeholders are
clamoring for: everything from which libraries (or individual
functions!) are in demand, to preventing the problems that get in the
way of successful science. This talk will show how XALT can provide
this type of job-level insight.  

XALT can provide a wide range of metrics and measures of
job-level activity. There are benefits to both users and stakeholders:
sponsoring institutions interested in strategic priorities;
organizations concerned about meeting users' needs; and those seeking
to study user activity to improve value and effectiveness.

We will show how this tool provides high value to centers and
their users as it can provide documentation on how an application was
built to provide reproducibility by reporting the exact environment in
which jobs were run.

We have been running XALT at TACC, one of the largest supercomputers
in the world and it has become mission critical for us to know what
programs to benchmark for new systems.  It has also told us what
programs that shouldn't be running in on the large memory nodes.
We will also describe using analytics on the big data generated.
