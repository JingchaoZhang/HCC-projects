These are some notes about things to add XALT.

* Support for Blacklist Env. Vars 
  The ignore list.

* checkExec:
   Needs three things:
   ReverseMap
   List of current loaded modules (__LOADEDMODULES__)
   Configuration between compilers, MPI Stacks and modules

   mvapich2 => libmpich2
   openmpi  => libompi
   ...
* xalt_site_pkg.py

   How to make this work better?

* xalt_syshost_default.py  
   mapping this to xalt_syshost.py?

* Analysis issues:

** What has changed over time?
   follow sha1 for some users and programs
** Field of Sci
   Who used namd that wasn't a chemist

** Compare C/F90/C++ vs. Runtime Libraries
   (Who mixes Fortran libraries with C++ (mgf?)
** percent use of TACC libraries

** What codes are associated with each other:

   namd & amber,
   etc.

** Track the use of OMP_NUM_THREADS
