Notes for XALT talk at SC 15 and Hackathon

* What is XALT?

Joint project between Mark Fahey and Robert McLay

Funded by NSF

See other slide sets

* Where are we?

The hardest thing is protecting XALT from What users do to the their
environment.

** Ways users can affect programs:
*** Setting PYTHONHOME to something that doesn't exist
*** B


** Protecting Python programs from users:

   The four ways that python can be affected: 

      LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PATH, PYTHONPATH, PYTHONHOME


  LD_LIBRARY_PATH="@ld_lib_path@" PATH= @python@ -E python-script ...

** Configuring XALT this way means that there must be a unique install for each operating system.

   In other words, if you have a shared file system between multiple
   cluster, you'll need one installation per cluster. not shared.

   => This is the cost of protecting XALT from what users can do to
   it.

* Database changes:

   * Show size of table on stampede from August;

   * New design of DB w.r.t. Environment variables.
      => save all as a json table in a blob that is compressed.
         - means all env vars can be retrieved but a much smaller set
           can be used for SQL tests.

* New trick: Track all executables.

  * use init_array, fini_array to register functions that are called
    before and after main.

  * Works with ELF binaries, Works with MACH binaries.
  => works with C/C++/Fortran.

  * Will show with Demo

* Upside: can now track scalar & Openmp pgrms

* Upside: no-longer need to write a parser for every site job launcher
   ibrun, aprun, mpirun, mympirun, srun, etc.

* Upside: no-longer need to walk the mpirun/aprun etc command line

   ** This is difficult to do

   ibrun tacc_affinity  <user_program>  O.K.

   ibrun env -u foo <user_program>  Not O.K.


* Downside:

  * Only track MPI jobs from task 0.

  * MPMD pgrms will only record the executable tied to task 0 and the
    other(s) will be missed.
  * Could be handled by reporting results from all tasks

  * We lose the ability to return the exit status.

* Not yet ready for release.

  * Now just linking it.  In other words, this won't track anything
    that is older than this new install of XALT.

  * The new release will
